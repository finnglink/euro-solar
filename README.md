# EURO-SOLAR

A very simple DIY euro rack module (16HP, Intellijel 1U format) to interact with the sun. Inspired by many other manufacturers. 
Very straightforward build, with just two parts and a 3D print ;)

**Possible future variations**
- 3U version
- 1U version with smaller cells

**Disclaimer!:**
I'm not an electrical engineer, I'm just doing this for fun. Please proceed at your own risk :)

# What You'll Need

- The 3D printed [panel](230619_FG_Euro-Solar.stl). **Important:** Print this with the indent for the panel TOWARDS the build plate, with supports. 
- One [53x30mm 5V solar cell](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09YH5SFQC?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)). 
- 1x Thonkiconn + washer, I'm using a Befaco Bananut for +1 style point.
- Depending on your exact type of solar cell, you might need some additional cable. The linked ones work as is.

- Soldering iron.
- Double sided tape to fix the solar cell in place.

# How To

1. Print the [panel](230619_FG_Euro-Solar.stl).
2. Remove the supports. Use a screwdriver or box cutter if needed. **Watch your fingers!**
3. Put some double sided tape in the indent, make sure to leave the holes for the cables free.
4. Feed the cables through and fix the solar cell in place.
5. Put in the Thonkiconn jack and fix it with the nut.
6. Shorten the wires and solder them to the jack. "-" goes to GND, "+" goes to the tip.
7. Put it in your 1U row and enjoy the sun ;)
